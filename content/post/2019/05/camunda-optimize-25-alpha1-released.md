# Sortable Tables in Process and Decision Reports

# Improved handling of Reports with many data points

# Searchable Process and Definition Dropdowns

Optimize is a tool that is especially useful, when you have a lot of data. Typically that includes a myriad of deployed process definitions within the data. However, selecting a process definition was very tedious in the past, especially if you had a lot of different definitions. That was due to how a user had to select definition name, which was rather inconvinient: the names were shown as a dropdown list and you had to sift through the whole list until you found your desired definition.

But that's in the past now, since picking your requested definition becomes a piece of cake with the new version. Just search for the name definition that you are looking for and immediately select the right name. It works for both for process and decision definitions. Have a look at the preview to get an impression how that works:

# What's Next?

The next alpha of Camunda Optimize 2.5 will be released on May 31, 2019. Our team is already working on it, adding both larger features and many small improvements.

After the next alpha release, we'll release the next minor **Camunda Optimize 2.5** at the end of the second quarter 2019. Stay tuned.
